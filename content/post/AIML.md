Introduction to Digital Image Processing:
The digital image processing is a process to perform image processing algorithms on digital images. Digital Image Processing contains the processing of images such as reading, analyzing and manipulating an image, and performing any kind of operation on the same such as improving the information representation of an image, processing the image data for storage, transmission and representation. Digital image processing is used in projects dealing with classification, feature extraction, pattern recognition, etc. Techniques that are used in digital image processing are Image editing, Image restoration, Linear filtering, Pixelation, Point feature matching, Principal components analysis, Independent component analysis, etc.

What is an Image?
An image is represented as a function F(a,b) which is 2-dimensional where a and b are the spatial or plane coordinates. The range of ‘F’ at any point of (a,b) is called the intensity of the image at that point. If a, b and the values of f are finite, the image is said to be a digital image. A digital image consists of pixels having particular locations and values. The value of pixel has ranged from 0 to 255.
